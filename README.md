# Shopping manager

This is a Software to manager stores, in Brazil we have something called "Shopping", that place has several stores inside. 
The first idea for this projects was to manage it but, for some obvious reasons, it's only a side project that I and some people from 
my old school (it's called "Technical school") build.
It manages others stores, cameras, employees and so on...
